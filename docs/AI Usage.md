        }
        
        
    }
not sure why these aren't working

### Response:

The issue seems to be in the way you are handling the `favourite` object returned from `this.#favService.addFavourite(req.body.name, req.userId)`. Specifically, you are using `!typeof favourite == 'error'` which is not the correct way to check if `favourite` is an instance of an `Error`. Also, the logic to handle the error and non-error cases needs adjustment.

Here's the corrected code:

1. **Controller Method**: `addFavourite` that handles the request and response.
2. **Service Method**: `addFavourite` that interacts with the database.

### Controller Method

```javascript
addFavourite = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        let favourite = await this.#favService.addFavourite(req.body.name, req.userId);

        if (!(favourite instanceof Error)) {
            const payload = await this.#favService.getFavourites(req.userId);
            console.log(payload, `<---`);
            res.status(200).json({ message: "Favourite added", favourites: payload });
        } else {
            throw favourite;
        }
    } catch (e) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: e.message });
    }
};
```

### Service Method

```javascript
addFavourite = async (location, userIDnum) => {
    try {
        const newFavourite = new Favourite({ name: location, userID: userIDnum });
        await newFavourite.save();
        return newFavourite;
    } catch (e) {
        return new Error(e.message); // Return an instance of Error
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Checking for Errors**: 
   - Use `!(favourite instanceof Error)` to check if `favourite` is an instance of `Error`. This is the correct way to determine if an error occurred.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - In the service method, if an error occurs, create and return an `Error` object using `new Error(e.message)`. This ensures that the error is properly recognized and handled by the controller.

3. **Consistent Return Types**:
   - Ensure that the service method always returns either a new `Favourite` object or an `Error` object.

This should resolve the issue and make the error handling more robust.

      Login tests
        correctly entering username and password logs you in and sends a token
          ✔ will respond with 200 and the users username and token.
        incorrectly entering username and password doesn't log you in
          ✔ will respond with 401 and not have a token.
        incorrectly entering username and password doesn't log you in
          ✔ will respond with 401 and not have a token.
      Password change tests
        confirm the password change route works and you can then log in with the new password
          ✔ should allow you to log in with the new password (40ms)
        confirm the password change refuses if the old password is incorrect
          ✔ should not allow you to change the password with the wrong password
        confirm the password change route works and you can't change the password with a bad token
          ✔ should result in a status 401
    Test of forecast route
      making a request to /about returns an array of 5 elements
        ✔ should return 200 and an array of 5 elements (75ms)
    Tests of favourites routes
      Get Favourites returns a list of favourites
        ✔ Should return an array in the body of the response
      Get Favourites refuses connections when bad token passed
        ✔ Should return an 401 status error
      Get Favourites refuses connections when no token passed
        ✔ Should return an 403 status error

  16 passing (572ms)

Your test coverage looks extensive and well-organized, covering several crucial aspects of your backend service. Here are a few additional areas you might consider testing to ensure even more robust coverage:

### 1. Edge Cases and Error Handling
- **Data Validation Errors:** Test endpoints with missing or invalid fields to ensure proper error handling and validation messages are returned.
- **Malformed Requests:** Test the endpoints with improperly formatted JSON or other malformed requests to ensure they handle these gracefully.

### 2. Security and Authorization
- **Token Expiry:** Ensure that expired tokens are rejected appropriately.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** If your system has different roles (e.g., admin, user), test that role-based access control is enforced correctly.
- **SQL/NoSQL Injection:** Test for injection vulnerabilities to ensure your input sanitization is effective.

### 3. Performance and Load Testing
- **Rate Limiting:** Ensure the application handles rate limiting correctly if applicable.
- **Stress Testing:** Test the application under heavy load to see how it behaves and whether it can handle high traffic.

### 4. Additional Functionality
- **Update User Profile:** If users can update their profile information, include tests for updating various fields.
- **Delete User Account:** Test the deletion of user accounts and ensure all related data is appropriately handled.
- **Password Reset:** If you have a password reset functionality, test the complete flow including token generation and validation.

### 5. Dependency Mocking
- **Mock External Services:** If your application interacts with external APIs (like the forecast service), ensure you have mocks for these to simulate various responses including success, failure, and timeouts.

### 6. Additional Routes and Methods
- **PUT/PATCH/DELETE Requests:** Ensure you cover all RESTful methods for the endpoints that support them.
- **Pagination and Filtering:** If your endpoints support pagination or filtering (e.g., fetching a list of users or favorites), test these functionalities.

### 7. Miscellaneous
- **Database Constraints:** Ensure that database constraints (like unique fields) are enforced correctly.
- **API Documentation Compliance:** If you have an API documentation (e.g., Swagger), ensure that your endpoints comply with it and that all documented features are tested.

Here are some examples of additional test cases based on the suggestions:

### Data Validation Errors
```javascript
describe("Post request to /newuser with invalid data", () => {
    it("Should respond with validation error", async () => {
        //Arrange
        const invalidUser = {
            "username": "",
            "password": "short",
            "email": "not-an-email",
            "name": ""
        };
        //Act
        const response = await request.post("/newuser").send(invalidUser);
        //Assert
        expect(response.status).to.equal(422);
        expect(response.body).to.have.property('error').that.includes('Validation error');
    });
});
```

### Token Expiry
```javascript
describe("Accessing protected route with expired token", () => {
    it("Should respond with token expired error", async () => {
        //Arrange
        const expiredToken = "someExpiredToken";
        //Act
        const response = await request.get("/favourites").set("token", expiredToken);
        //Assert
        expect(response.status).to.equal(401);
        expect(response.body).to.have.property('error').that.includes('Token expired');
    });
});
```

### Stress Testing (simplified example)
```javascript
describe("Stress test for login endpoint", function() {
    this.timeout(10000); // Set higher timeout for stress test
    it("Should handle multiple requests simultaneously", async () => {
        const loginPayload = {
            "username": "testGuy",
            "password": "test"
        };
        const requests = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            requests.push(request.post("/login").send(loginPayload));
        }
        const responses = await Promise.all(requests);
        responses.forEach(response => {
            expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
            expect(response.body).to.have.property('token');
        });
    });
});
```

Adding these tests will help you catch more potential issues and ensure your backend service is robust, secure, and performs well under various conditions.
