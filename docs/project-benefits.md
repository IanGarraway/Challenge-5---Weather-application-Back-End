# Project Benefits

The Backend service is what allows our websites to go beyond a simple static website and offer more of a dynamic service.

## Without it, we wouldn't be able to

- ### give the customer personalised data  
  
every user would get the exact same experience, we couldn't tailor it to their needs

- ### store their preferences
  
there would be no way to store a users preferences in a way which could applied on different access methods. while local storage could be used to track between sessions in the same browser, it wouldn't allow them to switch to a different device and could be lost.

- ### restrict what access they have
  
without a back end, to offer the sort of service proposed, would require exposing the sources to the end user. which could potentially allow them to bypass the service entirely. Potentially allow a competitor to repackage the site for their own use. It also means there is no way to limit what access to the data they do have, it's either there or it's not

- ### efficiently store and deliver data
  
without a back end to help tailor the site to the users needs, we would either be looking to create multiple pages for ever location they may think to visit, or uploading the data for every city.
  
## With a Back End though we can have the user

- create an account
- use that account to track their preferences
- Track their history
  
We can also combine other services into one site, allowing us to dynamically update the site with the latest information. Pull data from other sites and services, without exposing those to the user. Creating an engaging experience which has the user returning to the site sure it will meet their needs without having to explore multiple sites to do so.
